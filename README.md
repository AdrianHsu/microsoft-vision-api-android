The client library
==================

The Vision API client library is a thin Java client wrapper for Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford)
Vision REST APIs.  

The easiest way to consume the client library is to add com.microsoft.projectoxford.vision package from Maven Central Repository.

To find the latest version of client library, go to http://search.maven.org, and search for "com.microsoft.projectoxford".

To add the client library dependency from build.gradle file, add the following line in dependencies.

```
dependencies {
    //
    // Use the following line to include client library from Maven Central Repository
    // Change the version number from the search.maven.org result
    //
    compile 'com.microsoft.projectoxford:vision:0.5.0'

    // Your other Dependencies...
}
```

To do add the client library dependency from Android Studio:
1. From Menu, Choose File \> Project Structure
2. Click on your app module
3. Click on Dependencies tab
4. Click "+" sign to add new dependency
5. Pick "Library dependency" from the drop down list
6. Type "com.microsoft.projectoxford" and hit the search icon from "Choose Library Dependency" dialog
7. Pick the Project Oxford client library that you intend to use.
8. Click "OK" to add the new dependency



The sample
==========

This sample is an Android application to demonstrate the use of Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford)
Vision API.

It demonstrates image analysis, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and smart thumbnail generation.

Requirements
------------

Android OS must be Android 4.1 or higher (API Level 16 or higher)

Build the sample
----------------

1. First, you must obtain a Video API subscription key by following instructions in [Microsoft Cognitive Services subscription](<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up>).

2.  Start Android Studio and open project from Vision \> Android \> Sample folder.

3.  In Android Studio -\> "Project" panel -\> "Android" view, open file
    "app/res/values/strings.xml", and find the line
    "Please\_add\_the\_subscription\_key\_here;". Replace the
    "Please\_add\_the\_subscription\_key\_here" value with your subscription key
    string from the first step. If you cannot find the file "strings.xml", it is
    in folder "Sample\app\src\main\res\values\string.xml".

4.  In Android Studio, select menu "Build \> Make Project" to build the sample,
    and "Run" to launch this sample app.
